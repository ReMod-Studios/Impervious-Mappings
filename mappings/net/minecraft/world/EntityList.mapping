		COMMENT Ensures that the modified {@code entities} map is not currently iterated.
		COMMENT If {@code entities} is iterated, this moves its value to {@code temp} so

		COMMENT Runs an {@code action} on every entity in this storage.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT <p>If this storage is updated during the iteration, the iteration will
		COMMENT not be updated to reflect updated contents. For example, if an entity
		COMMENT is added by the {@code action}, the {@code action} won't run on that
		COMMENT entity later.
		COMMENT
		COMMENT @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this is called before an iteration
		COMMENT has finished, such as within the {@code action} or from another thread
